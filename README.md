I will learn flutter, mariadb(mysql), python, c#
and i want to learn web language such as js, html

and i tried to use eclepse
and i am using vsCode
flutter and mariadb is that to make my app student supporter
and python is making to AI to catch mouth motion
and c# is to make my game - scrifice and the true fear(the loop time)

student supporter is supporting study
why not study support or study supporter
because it is already exist!
so that's domain is very expensive

and it's ability is the check and order

AI for the hard of hearing people
that detect muscle movement and describe that to 3d
so hard of hearing people learn muscle movement
finaly they can speaking!


**border all of the comment is just my mind.**
